# Augmenta: Navigating the Intersection of AR and Driver Anxiety

> **The Mission:** Designing a voice-activated AR/VR windshield to reduce cognitive load and provide emotional support for drivers.
>
> **The Impact:** Successfully pivoted from a mobile-first entry point to a fully integrated HUD (Heads-Up Display) after usability testing revealed critical safety gaps in hands-free interaction.

## ## Overview

* **The Problem:** Modern drivers are overwhelmed by "screen fragmentation"—switching between mobile GPS and the road—leading to anxiety and dangerous distractions.
* **The Solution:** A patent-concept AR windshield that centralizes navigation and emotional support via multi-modal (voice + visual) inputs.
* **Context:** A 10-week intensive sprint for HCDE 518 (University of Washington).
* **My Role:** UX Researcher & Strategist (Collaborative team of 3).

## ## Understand

Storytelling is key here. Why did we focus on anxiety? 

We began with a broad question: *How can we keep eyes on the road?* However, our secondary research (Literature Review) and market audit revealed that "distraction" is often a symptom of driving anxiety.

* **The Strategic Shift:** We realized that reducing distraction wasn't enough; we had to address the **emotional state** of the driver.
* **The Goal:** Create a system that feels like a "co-pilot," not just a map.

## ## Research

This section demonstrates operational excellence and rapid decision-making within a tight 10-week constraint.



### Methodology & Rigor
* **Survey (n=24):** Validated pain points. **Insight:** 50% avoid tolls; 60% prioritize efficiency.
* **1:1 Qualitative Interviews (n=4):** Deep dives into driver psychology. **Insight:** Timeliness and clarity of instructions are the top anxiety reducers.
* **Literature Review:** Established a baseline for AR/VR cognitive load limits.

### Operational Artifacts
* [**Research Study Plan**](./link)
* **User Personas (V1 vs. V2):** We didn't just make personas; we iterated them. When our design pivoted, we "retired" the aggressive driver persona to focus on the **Inexperienced/Stressed Driver** who benefits most from emotional support features.

## ## Outcome & Impact

Demonstrating leadership through evidence-based decision making.

### The "Aha!" Moment: Usability Evaluation
We tested an initial prototype and hit an **"Interaction Barrier."** * **Evidence:** Participants were confused by the mobile app entry point and couldn't figure out how to interact with the windshield while keeping their hands at "10 and 2."
* **The Pivot:** We **discarded the mobile interface entirely**. We moved all logic to the windshield and voice-command system to ensure safety and continuity.



### Measurable Design Requirements
Based on two rounds of testing, we implemented five "Non-Negotiable" requirements:
1. **Adaptive Interface:** Users can scale UI elements based on personal visual needs.
2. **"Safe Place" Protocol:** A voice-activated feature to guide anxious users to the nearest stop.
3. **Multi-Modal Input:** Seamless transition between voice and manual controls.

> "I can't tell how to interact with this while my hands are on the wheel."  
> — **Participant 03**, *Leading to the removal of the mobile-entry requirement.*

## ## Takeaways

* **Operational Excellence:** Handled a major project pivot mid-sprint by re-coding our user flows and refining personas to match the new HUD-centric scope.
* **Leadership:** Mentored team members through the transition from low-fi storyboards to a high-fidelity Figma prototype that satisfied both "Anxiety" and "Distraction" objectives.
* **Future Vision:** If given a 20-week timeline, our focus would shift to **regulatory compliance testing (NHTSA standards)** to move from a concept to a "market-ready" safety tool.
