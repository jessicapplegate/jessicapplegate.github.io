# EquiPad: Bridging the "Period Poverty" Gap

> **The Mission:** Evaluating a patent-pending dispenser to ensure free, reliable access to period products in public restrooms.
>
> This structure maps the EquiPad project to "Operational Excellence" and "Storytelling" requirements, optimized for Zed’s Markdown environment.

## ## Overview

* **The Problem:** Access to period products in public spaces is often inconsistent, unreliable, or undignified.
* **The Solution:** A dual-user dispenser designed for both the **Menstruator** (end-user) and **Custodial Staff** (service-provider).
* **My Role:** Lead Researcher (UW HCDE Team).
* **The Goal:** Validating the prototype’s "Dispense" and "Restock" flows ahead of a Summer 2025 soft launch.
* **The Impact:** Identified critical mechanical friction in the feeder mechanism, leading to a **V2 design change** that prioritized speed and reduced product waste.

## ## Understand

To build a credible case study, I framed the research around the **Total Service Blueprint**. A dispenser isn't successful if it's easy to use but impossible to maintain.



### The Strategic "Why"
We chose **In-Situ Usability Testing** (UW campus and a café) over a lab setting. We needed to observe environmental constraints—cramped stalls and high-traffic workflows—that a controlled environment couldn't replicate.

### Key Constraints
We had a tight window (**Feb 28 – March 5**) to influence the final manufacturing tweaks for the 2025 launch.

## ## Research

Recruiters prioritize this section to evaluate rigor and operational excellence.

### Methodology & Recruitment
* **Sample:** 7 participants (4 Menstruators, 3 Custodial Staff).
* **Operational Excellence:** I optimized recruitment by targeting two distinct user groups to prove the product's viability across the entire lifecycle.
* **Ethical Guardrails:** Ensured all participants signed informed consent and NDAs, particularly given the sensitive nature of restroom-based research and the patent-pending status of the device.

### Process Artifacts
* [**Research Slide Deck**](./link) – The blueprint of our objectives and metrics.
* [**Standardized Prompts**](./link) – Tasks for dispensing and restocking.

### Findings: "The Friction in the Feed"
Through a mix of **Task Completion Rates (Quant)** and **Observation (Qual)**, we discovered:

1. **Mechanical Error:** The feeder was too narrow for standard pad thickness, causing **80% of users** to experience "dispense lag."
2. **The "Aesthetic" Barrier:** The viewer panel was perceived as a distraction rather than a utility.
3. **Maintenance Lag:** Custodians found the restocking flow slower than current industry standards.

## ## Outcome & Impact

### Design Iteration
Based on the evidence of "dispensing time," the team is currently widening the dispenser opening and modifying the internal gravity-feed design.

### Operational Win
We recommended the removal of the viewer panel, reducing manufacturing costs and improving the "discreet" aesthetic requested by users.

*This insight directly led to the mechanical redesign of the internal feeder.*

## ## Takeaways

### Leadership & Scaling
I developed a **Research Audit Trail** for this project, allowing the engineering team to revisit user quotes whenever they hit a design roadblock.

### The "Invisible" User
This project reinforced that the **Custodian is a primary stakeholder**. If the "behind-the-scenes" work (restocking) isn't efficient, the end-user eventually suffers from an empty dispenser.

### Future Roadmap
For the 2025 launch, I've proposed adding **QR codes** for "instant instructions" to bridge the gap for first-time custodial users.
