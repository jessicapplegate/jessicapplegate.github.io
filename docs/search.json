On this site, you will find selected writings and other works that I am proud of.\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n\nWhat are your cats named?\n– Juice and Onion\nWhere did you get your glasses?\n– Warby Parker! Although, I am currently shopping around for a more premium pair.\nWhat’s your favorite month?\n– I love November. I am a big fan of when it’s chilly enough outside to justify wearing a nice coat, but not cold to the point that I look like the Michelin man!\nWhere are you from?\n– I was born in Florida and moved to Georgia when I was 10. I’ve spent most of my life in the Southeast, but during the pandemic I picked up and moved to Maine for the heck of it!\n\n{https://github.com/jmgirard/embedpdf#installing}"
