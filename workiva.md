**Role:** UX Researcher (Graduate Intern / Employee)  
**Scope:** Financial Reporting & Complex Data Workflows / AI/ML Team embedded on Platform Tooling for WDesk
**Timeline:** May 2025 – Present

## ## Overview
At Workiva, I work within a high-stakes enterprise environment, conducting research to simplify complex financial reporting and compliance workflows. My work focuses on bridging the gap between sophisticated technical requirements and intuitive user experiences for accounting and finance professionals. Currently, a lot of my work is on automation and how agentic AI can be leveraged in regulated contexts. 

### The Challenge
Designing for enterprise means managing high-stakes data and collaborative complexity. I bridge the gap between legacy mental models and modern efficiency by uncovering friction in expert environments. By thoughtfully integrating AI into existing 'pro-tool' workflows, I enable users to meet strict regulatory demands with greater speed and fewer errors.
