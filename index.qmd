Hi! Welcome to my little website.

On this site, you will find my research portfolio, selected writing, R plots, and other works that I am proud of.

I'm a Master's student at the University of Washington in the Human-Centered Design & Engineering program. I moved to Seattle from Atlanta in Summer 2024 and am excited to see what the West Coast has in-store for me.

I'm glad you're here. Thanks for stopping by!

**Frequently asked questions:**

1.  What are your cats named?

    -- Juice and Onion.

2.  Where did you get your glasses?

    -- Warby Parker! Although, I am currently shopping around for a more *premium* pair.

3.  What's your favorite month?

    -- I love November. I am a big fan of when it's chilly enough outside to justify wearing a nice coat, but not cold to the point that I look like the Michelin man!

4.  Where are you from?

    -- I was born in Florida and moved to Georgia when I was 10. I've spent most of my life in the Southeast, but during the pandemic I picked up and moved to Maine for the heck of it!
