Hi! Welcome to my little website. On this site, you will find selected writings and other works that I am proud of.

**Frequently asked questions:**

1.  What are your cats named?

    -- Juice and Onion.

2.  Where did you get your glasses?

    -- Warby Parker! Although, I am currently shopping around for a more *premium* pair.

3.  What's your favorite month?

    -- I love November. I am a big fan of when it's chilly enough outside to justify wearing a nice coat, but not cold to the point that I look like the Michelin man!

4.  Where are you from?

    -- I was born in Florida and moved to Georgia when I was 10. I've spent most of my life in the Southeast, but during the pandemic I picked up and moved to Maine for the heck of it!
