# SHAPE JOY: Developmental Psychopathology & Empathic Longevity

> **The Mission:** A longitudinal virtual study investigating behavioral interventions to extend the duration of empathic joy in children.
> 
> **The Challenge:** Adapting complex, in-person observational methods for a virtual environment while maintaining high data integrity across diverse participant groups.

## ## Overview

* **The Problem:** Empathic joy is often fleeting in early development. This study sought to identify behavioral "anchors" that could extend this positive emotional state.
* **The Solution:** A multi-method virtual study combining quantitative surveys with live, moderated behavioral tasks.
* **My Role:** Research Lead (Operations & Data Analysis).
* **The Collaboration:** A joint initiative between the **Leaf Lab** and the **FEELINGS Lab** at Georgia State University.

## ## Understand

To understand how to measure "joy" virtually, we had to bridge the gap between clinical theory and remote feasibility.

### The Strategic "Why"
We shifted to a **Virtual Research Model** to increase participant accessibility and diversity. However, this required a complete overhaul of how we observed non-verbal cues.

### Secondary Research
I contributed to the refinement of research protocols, ensuring that our behavioral tasks were developmentally appropriate for a digital interface (**WebEx/Qualtrics**).

## ## Research

This section showcases my **Operational Excellence** and ability to manage a complex tech stack over a 12-month longitudinal period.



### Methodology & Operational Rigor
* **Recruitment & Pipeline Management:** Owned the end-to-end recruitment lifecycle. I used **Excel** and **SharePoint** to track participant milestones, ensuring zero drop-off between pre-assessment and behavioral sessions.
* **Quantitative Tooling:** Built and iterated on complex **Qualtrics** logic to capture real-time emotional self-reporting from child participants.
* **Observational Analysis:** Acted as a primary observer during behavioral tasks, coding qualitative behaviors into quantifiable data points for statistical analysis.

## ## Outcome & Impact

In UXR, handling "Inconclusive" results with rigor is just as important as a "win." My work focused on building the **Operational Infrastructure** for the study's long-term success.

* **Data Analysis:** Utilized **R** and **SPSS** to perform preliminary regression analyses. I identified specific "noise" in the data, which led to a critical refinement of the behavioral tasks.
* **Process Optimization:** Successfully transitioned the lab from manual scheduling to an automated tracking system, **reducing recruitment administrative time by 20%**.
* **Stakeholder Presentation:** Communicated complex psychopathological findings to an academic audience at the 2023 GSU Research Conference.

## ## Takeaways

### The "Rigorous" Mindset
This project taught me that "Inconclusive" results are often the most valuable; they force a researcher to audit their tools, screeners, and methods for hidden biases.

### Operational Excellence
I learned to manage sensitive participant data across multiple platforms (**WebEx**, **Qualtrics**, **R**) while maintaining strict ethical guardrails for developmental research.

### Technical Versatility
Bridged the gap between qualitative behavioral observation and high-level statistical programming in **R**, ensuring that "soft" emotional data could be analyzed with "hard" scientific rigor.
