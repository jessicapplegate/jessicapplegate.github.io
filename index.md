nav bar header: home, about, projects, resume, linkedin icon.
Maintain a flat information architecture where global pages (About, Contact, Workiva) are in the primary navigation, while detailed project case studies are nested sub-pages accessible exclusively via clicks on their respective cards on the Home gallery.
home: redirects to top of homepage index.md
about: redirects to about.md
projects: redirects to section with cards. each card contains a different project.
in each project are the following sections: Overview, Understand, Research, Outcome & Impact, Takeaways
resume: links to external page that displays a public version of my resume <https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MfiJ6FZPKg8WslcF1OjXYO_8v2TTUzG/edit>
linkedin icon: redirects to <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-applegate-197b6b230/>

___
include contents of about.md.
this page should have text on the left and an image on the right with an linkedin icon underneath the text that will redirect to <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-applegate-197b6b230/>

next include contents of projects.md
for each project there should be a card that includes: project title, image, description, and tags

for each project, there is an associated md file: augmenta.md, shape-joy.md, workiva.md, equipad.md, ai-health-outcomes.md
for each of these projects, we want to create a new page for example /project/workiva each project should be structured using the following logic. each project page will have a nav bar to the left that includes the following sections: overview, understand, reserch, outcome & impact, and takeaways.

## Overview
Space for a high-level hero image and a summary of the "Problem/Solution" narrative.

## Understand
Space for "The Why"—secondary research findings, stakeholder goals, and early sketches.

## Research
Space for documentation of methods, participant recruitment (Operational Excellence), and core artifacts like study plans or affinity maps.

## Outcome & Impact
Space for data visualizations, evidence-based quotes, and the final "Before vs. After" results.

## Takeaways
Space for reflections on leadership, democratization of research, and future project roadmaps.
