On this site, you will find selected writings and other works that I am proud of.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Frequently asked questions:**\n\n1.  What are your cats named?\n\n    -- Juice and Onion\n\n2.  Where did you get your glasses?\n\n    -- Warby Parker! Although, I am currently shopping around for a more *premium* pair.\n\n3.  What's your favorite month?\n\n    -- I love November. I am a big fan of when it's chilly enough outside to justify wearing a nice coat, but not cold to the point that I look like the Michelin man!\n\n4.  Where are you from?\n\n    -- I was born in Florida and moved to Georgia when I was 10. I've spent most of my life in the Southeast, but during the pandemic I picked up and moved to Maine for the heck of it!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#idk how to use this box yet\n```\n:::\n",
