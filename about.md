I'm **Jess**, a Master's student in **Human-Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE)** at the University of Washington. I'm a **UX Researcher** by day at **Workiva**, and a cat lady by night. 

On this site, you will find research works, R plots, and other digital artifacts I have created! 



### Beyond the Lab
* **Big Sister:** Family is a huge part of my life.
* **Gym Rat:** I love the discipline of the weight room.
* **Digital Media Lover:** I'm fascinated by how we tell stories in the modern age.
